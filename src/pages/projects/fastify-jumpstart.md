### Goals
- Familiarize myself with how to accomplish typical features needed for web api projects with the Fastify web framework.
- Setup Typescript to have type safety across auth flows and requests.
- Secure the framework with access and refresh token auth flow that can be plugged into any database.
- Setup the project for unit testing.
- Auto generating OpenAPI specs.
